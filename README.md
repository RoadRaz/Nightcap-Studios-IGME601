## Goals
The primary goals of this project are the following:
1. Practice with the development of a larger project over the course of a semester
2. To gain experience working as a part of a small team
3. To develop an impressive portfolio piece
4. To learn SCRUM planning and management
5. To have fun making a game

## Communications

### Discord
Communication is primarily over the Discord server. All conversations, notes, and other documented information will be kept in the Discord server.

### Meeting Times
Regular stand-up meetings will take place roughly at 3:00 PM on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. They will take place in GOL-2435 directly after IGME 602 ends. The meetings are meant to be just a few minutes long to inform the group on everyone's work and progress. 

## Management

### Trello
Trello is used to keep track of tasks that need to be done for the project. Members will be assigned to tasks as needed amongst all roles. All task management should be done over Trello.

### Google Drive
Google Drive is a pretty cool service where we can chuck large files at it and it'll save them. You can find the link here:

### Development Processes
Game development is impossibly hard, so we made a series of instructions for ourselves detailing how to do some basic things when working on our game. Those instructions can be found here:

## Branching Strategy
A feature-based branching strategy will be used for this project. New features will be developed in their own branch before being merged into the "master" branch. Bug fixes are treated the same way.
