4. To learn SCRUM planning and management

## Mission Statement
_Replace this with the overall objectives that your team has agreed upon._
_What is the goal of the project (from a learning and product perspective)? Who is your target audience? How will you define success?_

## Communications

### Discord
Communication is primarily over the Discord server. All conversations, notes, and other documented information will be kept in the Discord server.

### Meeting Times
Regular stand-up meetings will take place roughly at 3:00 PM on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. They will take place in GOL-2435 directly after IGME 602 ends. The meetings are meant to be just a few minutes long to inform the group on everyone's work and progress. 

## Management

### Trello
Trello is used to keep track of tasks that need to be done for the project. Members will be assigned to tasks as needed amongst all roles. All task management should be done over Trello.

## Repository Overview
_As the project progresses, add notes here about how the repository is organized, how branches are being used, etc._

- [Course schedule](https://people.rit.edu/~esmvcs/files/2185/IGME106_Course_Schedule_2185.htm)
- This [UML class diagram reference](https://www.uml-diagrams.org/class-reference.html) probably has more than you'll need, but it's a good starting point.
- [Markdown](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/markdown.html) is a convenient method of documentation because it can have nice formatting while still being a plain text file (which allows multiple team members to edit sections and view/merge differences). _(I'm requiring it for this project because it also allows me to easily see changes over time and who worked on different sections of a document.)_


_You can incorporate images into this document by adding them to the folder and then linking them using the markdown syntax `![alt text](relative path to image file)`._ 

_For example `![Art example alt text](doc/art_example.jpg)` results in:_

![Art example alt text](doc/art_example.jpg)
